# russian-roulette
## a collection of very risky "games"

russian-roulette is a repository containing Russian Roulette games in various programming languages.

## THESE ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND DANGEROUS SCRIPTS. DON'T RUN THESE UNLESS YOU ARE FINE WITH YOUR COMPUTER BEING COMPLETELY DESTROYED. I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS. IF YOU RUN THESE, YOU ACCEPT THE RISK OF HAVING A BROKEN COMPUTER.

This repository is a joke.
All the same, if you *do* still want to run these, feel free to do so. (These only work on Linux.) Just do something like this:
`sudo python3 rr.py` or `sudo node rr.js` or `sudo R rr.r`.
## Again, be careful- these can actually wreck your computer. It's possible that everything you worked so hard to do will be gone forever. These scripts completely delete the entire OS.
